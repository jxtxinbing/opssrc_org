Sending Your First Patch For Review
===================================

To submit your first patch:

1. To submit patches and develop for OpenSwitch, you must have a [github](https://github.com/) account. Please create an account if you do not already have one.
2. Log in to the [OpenSwitch gerrit system](http://review.openswitch.net/) using your github account.
3. Add your public SSH key to your account so you can submit patches using
  gerrit-review.
4. Clone the repository you are interested in submitting patches for. A full
  list of repositories can be found at the top of the gerrit system.
5. Create a local branch and make your changes locally.
6. Commit your changes ensuring you use "-s" to git commit. This ensures you
  have the Developers Certificate of Origin ([DCO](http://governance.openswitch.net/governance/contributor-onboarding.html#licensing-of-contributions)), which is needed for
  all commits.
7. Push your changes using "git review".
