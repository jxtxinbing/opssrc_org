# High-level design of control plane policing
Control plane policing (CoPP) protects usage of the CPU by prioritizing and rate-limiting control plane traffic. The current implementation defines default packet classes with date rate limits and queue values during plugin initialization. More detailed documentation of the design and defaults for OpeNsl-based platforms can be found in the component design of the opennsl plugin (/documents/dev/ops-switchd-opennsl-plugin/DESIGN).
