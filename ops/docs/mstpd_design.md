```
The ops-stpd daemon monitors the MSTP related schema in the database. As the configuration and state information for the ports and interfaces are changed, ops-stpd examines the data to determine if there are new Instances being defined in the configuration and if state information for interfaces has changed. The ops-stpd daemon uses this information to configure MSTP Instances and update the MSTP protocol state machines.

The ops-stpd daemon registers for MSTP BPDUs on all L2-Ports configured for MSTP, and sends and receives BPDUs to the peer via the L2-Ports.

When the state information maintained by ops-stpd changes, it updates the information in the database. Some of this information is strictly status, but this also includes hardware configuration, which is used by ops-switchd to configure the switch.

```
When we configure only CIST and enable a spanning-tree MSTP BPDUs will be sent out with a length of 119 bytes incremented by 16 bytes for each instance.

Maximum of 64 MSTP instances can be configured and each instance will have an exclusive,non-overlapping set of VLANs. Hence, the Maximum size of a packet can be 1147 bytes.
##Internal structure
The ops-stpd daemon has three operational threads:
* ovsdb_thread
  This thread processes the typical OVSDB main loop, and handles any changes. Some changes are handled by passing messages to the mstpd_protocol_thread thread.
* mstpd_protocol_thread
  This thread processes messages sent to it by the other two threads. Processing of the messages includes operating the finite state machines.
* mstp_rx_pdu_thread
  This thread waits for MSTP BPDUs on interfaces. When a MSTP BPDU is received, it sends a message (including the packet data) to the mstpd_protocol_thread thread for processing through the state machines.
##OVSDB Event Handling
The ops-stpd daemon handles multiple events received from OVSDB updates.
* L2-Port Add:
  When a L2-Port is created in OVSDB, daemon will creata a entry for CIST_port and MSTI_port if exists. Updates the daemon data structures and if MSTP is enabled it triggers the state machines which are relevant. Split/LAG ports does not have any special functionality from ops-stpd perspective.
  Splitting a L2-Port will result in L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Add.
  Creating a LAG will also result in L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Add.
* L2-Port Delete:
  When a L2-Port is being removed in OVSDB, daemon will remove the respective CIST and MSTI port entries. Clears the daemon data structures for the ports being deleted. Split/LAG ports does not have any special functionality from ops-stpd perspective.
  Unsplitting a L2-Port will result in L2-Port Deletes and L2-Port Add.
  Deleting a LAG will result in deletion of L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Adds.
  Modifying a LAG will result in deletion of L2-Port Delete.
* VLAN Add:
  When a VLAN is being added in OVSDB, daemon will map newly added VLAN into CIST by default. In Daemon restart scenario, daemon will check if the VLAN is already mapped in CIST/MSTI and the add into CIST or ignore if present.
* VLAN Delete:
  When a VLAN is being deleted in OVSDB, daemon will unmap the VLANS from CIST/MSTI wherever it is mapped. When the last VLAN is being deleted from Instance, Instance should be deleted from the daemon.
* Packet Receive:
  The ops-stpd daemon process the MSTP BPDUs from the Peers, and compares with the config related parameters in the DB.

Daemon calculates the priority vectors and takes a decision on the ports which has to be forwarded and blocked.
ops-stpd also updates DB on the state changes/statistics/status parameters in interfaces based on priority vectors.

Once daemon sets port state as Forwarding/Blocking/Learning, switchd plugin shall take care of setting the values into the ASIC.
##Daemon Restartablity
When a ops-stpd crashes, daemon cleans up the status and statistics columns on restart with the configuration columns intact in the DB.
##Other Feature Interactions
As MSTP is one of the features that can bring up/down a port, it aligns with the  [Port Pecking Order Design](http://git.openswitch.net/cgit/openswitch/ops/plain/docs/port_state_pecking_order_design.md) which facilitates multiple such features to inter-operate. An example of such an interaction would be between LAG and MSTP.

MSTP can operate over LAGs (static or dynamic) in the same way that it operates over physical interfaces.
Please refer to [Link Aggregation Design](http://git.openswitch.net/cgit/openswitch/ops/tree/docs/link_aggregation_design.md)
##CoPP for MSTP
The default CoPP profile for MSTP in OPS restricts number of MSTP BPDUs sent to CPU per second to 1000 packets and that MSTP packets will be sent on the highest priority queue "10" to the CPU.
Refer to [CoPP User Guide](http://git.openswitch.net/cgit/openswitch/ops/plain/docs/CoPP_user_guide.md?h=rel/dill)
##Troubleshooting Support
ops-stpd daemon has some support for debugging in case of any issues.
There are multiple options to troubleshoot ops-stpd daemon
1. diag-dump mstp basic : This will dump all the relevant data from the ops-stpd daemon..
2. Bash commands: To see the segregated data based on Instances or Ports. Below are the commands
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/ovsdb/cist
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/ovsdb/cist_port <port>
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/ovsdb/msti <msti>
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/ovsdb/msti_port <msti> <port>
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/daemon/cist
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/daemon/cist_port <port>
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/daemon/msti <msti>
* ovs-appctl -t ops-stpd mstpd/daemon/msti_port <msti> <port>
3. show tech mstp : This will show all the data related to MSTP.
4. show events mstp: This will show all the events related to MSTP.
